The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention.
It is the most important product of his creative brain.
Its ultiate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world,
the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs.

This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded.
But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the
knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race
would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.
